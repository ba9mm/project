      <p class="about-paragraph">
        If you're a sports nerd like me, you're always looking for that next
        stat to blow your mind. Wait you're not? Then get off this page! <br />
        Whew - now that all the fake fans are gone, it's time to explore some of
        the most incredible stats from the Big 4 sports that are unknown to the
        masses. I have compiled these records through countless hours of wasted
        time on youtube, heated debates with friends and loved ones, and other
        just as accurate sources. That said, I hope you enjoy the site and are
        able to arm yourself with some of the most under appreciated sports
        facts ever.

          that he's a wealth of information in regards to sports stats. No link
          for him, just let me know if you want to speak with him.
